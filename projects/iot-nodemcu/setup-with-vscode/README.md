# Visual Studio Code Setup

I am more familiar with coding in VScode than Arduino IDE
It comes with autocomplete and everything you need too.

## Instructions
1. Install Arduino extension from microsoft
2. Put the files in this folder inside your .vscode folder
3. Change {{every text wrap like this}} to follow your own settings
4. Note that default board is NodeMCU
5. Try include some external library in your sketch, to make sure it working fine
